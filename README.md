## phengine  
the world's worst 2D C#-based game engine (can you really call it that?)  
  
probably'll get worked on when i get bored lol  
if you want to compile it, you can, it's nothing special. no external dependencies as of yet.  
`--debug` or compile as debug to enable console.

see [TODO.md](planning/TODO.md) to see checklist of things. this will get expanded as i determine what i want to add.
