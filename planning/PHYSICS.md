very bluntly. i'm bad at math, so i am immediately unsure if i want to write my own physics solver or if i want to find one that fits my needs well that i am able to just jam in place.

- https://github.com/nkast/Aether.Physics2D fork of Farseer 3.5/Box2D. still updated.
- https://github.com/Genbox/VelcroPhysics fork of Farseer. feature-ish complete, and no longer updated.

will determine eventually what the outcome for this choice will be, more focused on implementing other functionality right now.
  
leaning towards attempting to implement own very very very basic solver. don't need many bells and whistles.

if creating own solver would need:
- [ ] collider types
  - [ ] box
  - [ ] sphere
- [ ] some kind of collision event type
